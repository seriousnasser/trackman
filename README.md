## More info
- Project's storage is localstorage
- IE 11 and below is not project's target
- test covered for some services and components (appx 20% coverage)
- used hash map data structure for increase find performance (O(1))
- automatically deploys on Github pages after each push on main branch
- using mui with css-in-js approach and css modules together in the same project is not optimal, I did in this project for speed up development.
